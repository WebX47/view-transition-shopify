# View-Transition-Shopify

This was just a fast test, and I plan to make it better when [SPX](https://spx.js.org/) is available. For now, I'm writing this short readme to help me find the changes I made in the Shopify theme to use View-Transition.

- **viewTrans.js**
- **viewTrans.css**
- **product-media-gallery.liquid** (Added the attribute `style="view-transition-name: prod-img"` to this file)
